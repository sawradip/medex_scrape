       "       \"In principle, the dosage of Glimepiride is governed by the desired blood sugar level. The dosage of Glimepiride must be the lowest which is sufficient to achieve the desired metabolic control. The initial and the maintenance doses are set based on the results of regular check of glucose in blood and urine. Monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine also serves to detect either primary or secondary failure of therapy.Initial dose and dose titration: the usual initial dose is 1 mg once daily, if necessary, the daily dose can be increased. Any increase can be based on regular blood sugar monitoring, and should be gradual, i.e., at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks, and carried out stepwise, as follows: 1 mg -> 2 mg -> 3 mg -> 4 mg -> 6 mg.Dose in patients with well controlled diabetes: the usual dose range in patients with well controlled diabetes is 1 to 4 mg daily.Distribution of doses: Timing and distribution of doses are decided by the physician, in consideration of the patient's current life-style. Normally, a single daily dose is sufficient. This should be taken immediately before a substantial breakfast or if none is taken immediately before the first main meal. It is very important not to skip meals after taking the drug.Secondary dosage adjustment: As control of diabetes improves, sensitivity to insuiin increases; therefore, Glimepiride requirement may fall as treatment proceeds. To avoid hypoglycaemia, timely dose reduction or cessation of Glimepiride therapy must be considered. A dose adjustment must also be considered whenever the patient's weight or life-styie changes, or other factors arise which cause an increased susceptibility to hypo or hyperglycaemia.Changeover from other oral antidiabetics to Glimepiride: There is no exact dosage relationship between Glimepiride and other oral blood sugar lowering agents. When substituting Glimepiride for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeover from maximum dose of other oral blood sugar lowering agents. Any dose increase should be in accordance with guideline given above in 'initial dose and dose titration'. Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar lowering agent. It may be necessary to interrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.\",\n",

When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Erythropoietin alfa by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Erythropoietin alfa dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue Erythropoietin alfa if responsiveness does not improve.For patients with CKD on dialysis:Initiate Erythropoietin alfa treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Erythropoietin alfa.The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 units/kg3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

If necessary, the daily dose may be increased. Generally, it is recommended that a total daily dose of 30 mg is not exceeded.Elderly: Increased responsiveness and higher susceptibility to adverse effects may be present in elderly patients and require low initial doses and gradual dose increments under careful observation.

A daily dose of 5 to 10 mg clobazam is frequently sufficient. Benzodiazepines must not be given to children without careful assessment of the need for their use.Secondary dosage adjustment: After the improvement of the symptoms, the dose may be reduced.Timing of doses: If the dose is to be spread throughout the day, it is recommended that the larger portion be taken in the evening.Duration of treatment: The duration of treatment must be as short as possible. The patient must be reassessed after a period not exceeding 4 weeks and regularly thereafter in order to evaluate the need for continued treatment, especially where the patient is free of symptoms. Generally, the overall duration of treatment (i.e. including tapering-of process) must not exceed 8 to 12 weeks. In certain cases, extension beyond the maximum treatment period may be necessary; treatment must not be extended without a re-evaluation of the patient's status using special expertise. It is strongly recommended that prolonged periods of uninterrupted treatment be avoided, since they may lead to dependence.Discontinuation of treatment: It is strongly recommended that after prolonged treatment clobazam is not withdrawn suddenly but rather that the dose is reduced gradually under medical supervision; otherwise, withdrawal symptoms may occur.Treatment of epilepsy in combination with one or more other anticonvulsants-Adults and adolescents over 15 years of age: It is recommended that administration be started at small doses (5 to 15 mg daily), if necessary, increasing the dose gradually to a maximum daily dose of about 80 mg.Children from 3 to 15 years of age: It is recommended that normally treatment be started at 5 mg daily.

If twice daily dosing with Insulin Aspart results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing).The dose should not be increased if hypoglycemia occurred within three days. Dose adjustments can be made once a week until target HbA1c is reached. In patients with type 1 diabetes the individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg/day. Insulin Aspart may fully or partially meet this requirement. When transferring a patient from biphasic human insulin to Insulin Aspart, start with the same dose and regimen. Then titrate according to individual needs (according to the titration guidelines in table above). Insulin Aspart can be used in elderly patients; however there is limited experience with the use of Insulin Aspart in combination with OADs in patients older than 75 years.',\n",

       "       \"Insulin Aspart has a faster onset and a shorter duration of action than soluble human insulin. Due to the faster onset of action, Insulin Aspart should generally be given immediately before a meal. When necessary Insulin Aspart may be given soon after a meal.Dosage of Insulin Aspart is individual and determined on the basis of the physician's advice in accordance with the needs of the patient. It should normally be used in combination with long-acting insulin given at least once a day.The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/kg/day in adults and children over 2 years of age. In a meal-related treatment 50-70% of this requirement may be provided by Insulin Aspart and the remainder by long-acting insulin. Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.Subcutaneous Injection: Insulin Aspart should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. Because Insulin Aspart has a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of activity than human regular insulin, it should be injected immediately (within 5-10 minutes) before a meal Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) by External Pump Insulin Aspart can also be infused subcutaneously by an external insulin pump. The initial programming of the external insulin infusion pump should be based on the total daily insulin dose of the previous regimen. Approximately 50% of the total dose is usually given as meal-related boluses of Insulin Aspart and the remainder is given as a basal infusion. When used with an infusion pump Insulin Aspart should not be mixed with any other insulin.Intravenous Use: Insulin Aspart can be administered intravenously under medical supervision for glycemic control with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. For intravenous use, Insulin Aspart should be used at concentrations from 0.05 IU/mL to 1.0 IU/mL insulin aspart in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags.

This dose can be expected to produce good or excellent non-emergency intubation conditions in 2.5 to 3.0 minutes after injection. In caesarean section and neonatal surgery the dose should not exceed 0.1 mg/kg. Like other neuromuscular blocking agents, Vecuronium Bromide should only be administered by, or under supervision of, experienced clinicians who are familiar with the action and use of these agents; the dosage of Vecuronium Bromide should be individualized in each patient. Consequently, adjustments with Vecuronium Bromide should be made by administering smaller maintenance doses at less frequent intervals or by using lower infusion rates of Vecuronium Bromide during long lasting procedures (longer than 1 hour) under inhalational anaesthesia. In adult patients the following dosage recommendations may serve as a general guideline for tracheal intubation and muscle relaxation for short to long lasting surgical procedures.Tracheal intubation: The standard intubating dose during routine anaesthesia is 0.08 to 0.1 mg Vecuronium Bromide per kg body weight, after which adequate intubation conditions are established within 90 to 120 seconds in nearly all patients.Dosages of Vecuronium Bromide for surgical: procedures after intubation with suxamethonium: If suxamethonium is used for intubation, the administration of Vecuronium should be delayed until the patient has clinically recovered from the neuromuscular block induced by suxamethonium. Recommended dose is 0.03 to 0.05 mg Vecuronium Bromide per kg body weight.Maintenance dosing: The recommended maintenance dose is 0.02 to 0.03 mg Vecuronium Bromide per kg body weight. These maintenance doses should best be given when twitch height has recovered to 25% of control twitch height.Dose requirements for administration of Vecuronium Bromide by continuous infusion: If Vecuronium is administered by continuous infusion, it is recommended to give a loading dose (0.08 to 0.1 mg Vecuronium Bromide per kg body weight) first and, when neuromuscular block starts to recover, to start administration of Vecuronium by infusion. The infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain twitch response at 10% of control twitch height or to maintain 1 to 2 responses to train of four stimulation. In adults, the infusion rate required to maintain neuromuscular block at this level, ranges from 0.8 to 1.4 µg Vecuronium Bromide/kg/min. Repeat monitoring of neuromuscular block is recommended since infusion rate requirements vary from patient to patient and with the anaesthetic method used.Dosing in elderly patients: The same intubation and maintenance doses as for younger adults (0.08-0.1 mg/kg and 0.02-0.03 mg/kg, respectively) can be used. The onset time in elderly is similar to younger adults.Dosing in paediatric patients: Neonate (up to 4 weeks) and children up to 4 months: initial test dose 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg then incremental doses until 90% to 95% depression of twitch response is achieved is recommended. In neonatal surgery the dose should not exceed 0.1 mg/kg. Children over 5 months to 10 years: 0.08-0.1 mg/kg (children under 12 months, onset more rapid and high intubation dose may not be required); maintenance 0.02-0.03 mg/kg adjusted according to response. Since the duration of action is shorter in children, maintenance doses are required more frequently.Dosing in overweight and obese patients: When used in overweight or obese patients doses should be reduced taking into account an ideal body weight. Initial doses ranging from 0.15 mg up to 0.30 mg Vecuronium Bromide per kg body weight have been administered during surgery both under halothane and neurolept anaesthesia.',\n",

       "       'There are great inter-and intra-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous gonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, therefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. This requires ultrasonography and monitoring of oestradiol levels. There should be consideration to minimize the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. FSH can be given either alone, or in combination with a GnRH analogue to prevent premature luteinisation. In the latter case, especially when using a GnRH agonist, a higher total treatment dose of FSH may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response. Clinical experience with FSH is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.Ovulation Induction in Women: Starting daily dose of 50 international units (IU) of FSH is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly for at least the first 7 days. The dose is increased by 25 or 50 international units (IU) at weekly intervals until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate response. When an acceptable pre-ovulatory state is achieved, final oocyte maturation is achieved with 5000 to 10,000 international units (IU) of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The woman and her partner should have intercourse daily, beginning on the day prior to the administration of HCG and until ovulation becomes apparentAssisted Reproductive Technology (ART): In Women; Starting dose of 150 to 225 international units (IU) of FSH is administered intramuscularly for at least the first 4 days of treatment. Subsequent doses are adjusted based upon ovarian response as determined by ultrasound evaluation of follicular growth and serum estradiol levels. Final oocyte maturation is induced with a dose of 5000-10,000 international units of HCG Oocyte (egg) retrieval is performed 34 to 36 hours laterPolycystic Ovarian Hyperstimulation (PCOS): FSH injections are therefore given each morning as an intramuscular injection. It is best to start with the lowest dose of FSH per day (using 50 IU per day). These doses are used for 4 to 6 days at a time. The ovarian response is determined by measuring oestrogen levels in the blood. When the oestrogen begins to rise, the FSH is successfully growing an egg or eggs. If there is no response to a dose of FSH in 5- 6 days of injections the dose will be increased. The normal dose increments are 75 units, 112 units, 150 units and 225 units per day. Most patients respond with 75 to 150 IU per day. However it is very important that increments are only made cautiously.Dosage in Male: Induction of Spermatogenesis in Men Pre-treatment with HCG alone (1500 international units (IU) twice weekly) is required. If serum testosterone levels have not normalized after 8 weeks of HCG treatment, the dose may be increased to 3000 international units (IU) twice a week. After normalization of serum testosterone levels, administer 450 international units (IU) per week (225 international units twice weekly or 150 international units (IU) three times weekly) of FSH subcutaneously with the same pre-treatment HCG dose used to normalize testosterone level.',\n",

       "       'Sterility in females: The dosage of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin for the induction of follicle growth in normo-or hypogonadotropic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovarian and measuring estradiol levels. If the Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni-and bilateral follicle growth can occur. Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin continues until the pre-ovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, 5000 or 10000 IU HCG are injected i.m. 1 to 2 days after the last Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin administration.Note: After a Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin dosage too high for the corresponding individual has been administered the following HCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries.Sterility in males: Initially, 2 X 5000 IU HCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin (3 X 75-150 IU FSH + 75 - 150 IU LH) per week is administered for a few months.',\n",

Re-dosing may occur 30 minutes after the start of administration of Fentanyl and the same dosage strength should be used.Increasing the dose:Titration should be initiated using multiples of the 100 mcg Fentanyl tablet. Patients require to titrate above 100 mcg can be instructed to use two 100 mcg tablets (one on each side of the mouth in the buccal cavity). If this dose is not successful in controlling the breakthrough pain episode, the patient may be instructed to place two 100 mcg tablets on each side of the mouth in the buccal cavity (total of four 100 mcg tablets). Titrate above 400 mcg by 200 mcg increments bearing in mind using more than 4 tablets simultaneously has not been studied and it is important to minimize the number of strengths available to patients at any time to prevent confusion and possible overdose. To reduce the risk of overdose during titration, patients should have only one strength of Fentanyl tablet available at any one time.Dosage Adjustment:Generally, the dose of Fentanyl should be increased when patients require more than one dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.Injection-Fentanyl injection can be administered intravenously either as a bolus or by infusion & by intramuscular route also. The dose of fentanyl should be individualized according to age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs and type of surgery and anesthesia.Doses in excess of 200mcg are for use in anesthesia only. As a premedicant, 1-2 ml fentanyl may be given intramuscularly 45 minutes before induction of anesthesia. After IV administration in unpremedicated adult patients, 2ml fentanyl may be expected to provide sufficient analgesia for 10-20 minutes in surgical procedures involving low pain intensity. 10 ml fentanyl injected as a bolus gives analgesia lasting about one hour. The analgesia produced is sufficient for surgery involving moderately painful procedures. Giving a dose of 50mcglkg fentanyl will provide intense analgesia for some four to six hours, for intensely stimulating surgery.Fentanyl may also be given as an infusion. In ventilated patients, a loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a fast infusion of approximately 1 mcg/kg/min for the first 10 minutes followed by an infusion of approximately 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Alternatively the loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a bolus. Infusion rates should be titrated to individual patient response; lower infusion rates may be adequate. Unless it is planned to ventilate post operatively, the infusion should be terminated at about 40 minutes before the end of surgery.Lower infusion rates, e.g. 0.05-0.08 mcg/kg/min. are necessary if spontaneous ventilation .is to be maintained. Higher infusion rates (up to 3 mcg/kg/min) have been used in cardiac surgery. Fentanyl is chemically incompatible with the induction agents thiopentone & methohexitone because of wide differences in pHUse in elderly and debilitated patients: It is wise to reduce the dosage in the elderly and debilitated patients.

       "       'Adults:Induction of general anaesthesia: The dosage of Propofol should be titrated individually against the response of the patient. The ordinary initial dosage in adults is 40 mg (4 ml) by slow intravenous bolus injection at intervals of 10 seconds until the clinical signs show the onset of anaesthesia. The ordinary induction dose in healthy patient below 55 years of age is 2.2-2.5 mg/kg. A dose of 1.0-1.5 mg/kg is often sufficient for older patient. Lower doses, most often 20 mg (2 ml) at intervals of 10 seconds, are recommended for patient of ASA grades 3 and 4.Maintenance of general anaesthesia: Anaesthesia can be maintained by administering Propofol either by continuous infusion or by repeat bolus injections to maintain sufficient anaesthesia.Continuous infusion: The required rate of infusion varies considerably between patients. At the onset of anaesthesia (during roughly the first 10-20 minutes), some patient may require a slightly higher infusion rate (8-10 mg/kg/h). However, sufficient anaesthesia is normally achieved by infusing 4-6 (up to 12) mg/kg/h of Propofol. Repeat bolus injections: 25-50 mg (2.5-5.0 ml) bolus injections, depending on response.Sedation during intensive care: A bolus injection of 1.0-2.0 mg/kg should be given first, followed by continuous infusion adjusted according to required degree of sedation. An infusion rate of 0.3-4 mg/kg/h is usually sufficient.Sedation for surgical and diagnostic procedures: Dosages shall be adjusted individually. Sufficient sedation for surgical and diagnostic procedures can usually be achieved by administering initially 0.5-1 mg/kg during 1-5 minutes, and maintained by continuous at a rate of 1-4.5 mg/kg/h. Bolus dose of 10-20 mg can be given in addition, should deeper sedation be suddenly required. Lower doses of Propofol are often sufficient for patient of ASA grades 3 and 4, and for older patient.Children:Propofol is not recommended for use in children less then 3 years of age as its safety has not been demonstrated.Induction of general anaesthesia: Dosage of Propofol in children shell be adjusted for weight and age. The mean induction dosage in children over 8 years is 2.5 mg/kg, given by slow intravenous injection until the clinical signs show the onset of anaesthesia. Younger children may need slightly higher doses of propofol per kilogram of weight. Lower dosages are recommended for children of ASA grades 3 and 4.Maintenance of general anaesthesia: Anaesthesia can be maintained by administering Propofol either by continuous infusion or by repeat bolus injections. Dosage shall be adjusted individually, but an infusion rate of 9-15 mg/kg/h is usually sufficient to achieve satisfactory anaesthesia.Sedation during intensive care, surgical diagnostic procedures: Propofol is not recommended for sedation in children as its efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated. Although no casual relationship has been established, serious adverse events (including fatalities) have been reported in cases, where propofol has been used against recommendations. Adverse events have most commonly been seen in children with respiratory tract infections given doses in excess of those recommended for adults.',\n",

       "       'To prevent painful injections and minimize leakage from the injection site rFSH should be slowly administered subcutaneously. The subcutaneous injection site should be alternated to prevent lipoathrophy. Any unused solution should be discarded. Subcutaneous injection of rFSH may be carried out by patient or partner, provided that proper instructions are given by the physician. Self-administration of rFSH should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.Dosage in Female:There are great inter and intra-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous gonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set an uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, therefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. This requires ultrasonography and monitoring of estradiol levels. There should be consideration to minimize the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. rFSH can be given either alone, or in combination with a GnRH analogue to prevent premature luteinisation. In the latter case, especially when using a GnRH agonist, a higher total treatment dose of rFSH may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response. Clinical experience with rFSH is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.Ovulation Induction in Women: Starting daily dose of 75 international units (IU) of rFSH is administered subcutaneously or subcutaneous for at least the first 7 days. The dose is increased by 25 or 75 international units (IU) at weekly intervals until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate response. When an acceptable pre-ovulatory state is achieved, final oocyte maturation is achieved with 5000 to 10,000 international units (IU) of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The woman and her partner should have intercourse daily, beginning on the day prior to the administration of HCG and until ovulation becomes apparent.Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART): In Women, Starting dose of 150 to 300 international units (IU) of rFSH is administered subcutaneous for at least the first 4 days of treatment. Subsequent doses are adjusted based upon ovarian response as determined by ultrasound evaluation of follicular growth and serum estradiol levels. Final oocyte maturation is induced with a dose of 5000-10000 international units of HCG Oocyte (egg) retrieval is performed 34 to 36 hours later.PCOS: rFSH injections are therefore given each morning as a subcutaneous injection. It is best to start with the lowest dose of rFSH per day (using 75 IU per day). These doses are used for 4 to 6 days at a time. The ovarian response is determined by measuring estrogen levels in the blood. When the estrogen begins to rise, the rFSH is successfully growing an egg or eggs. If there is no response to a dose of rFSH in 5-6 days of injections the dose will be increased. The normal dose increments are 75 units, 100 units, 150 units and 300 units per day. Most patients respond with 75 IU to 150 IU per day. However it is very important that increments are only made cautiously.Dosage in Male: Induction of Spermatogenesis in Men: Pre-treatment with HCG alone (2500 international units twice weekly) is required. If serum testosterone levels have not normalized after 8 weeks of HCG treatment, the dose may be increased to 5000 international units (IU) twice a week. After normalization of serum testosterone levels, administer 300 international units (IU) per week (300 international units twice weekly or 100 international units three times weekly) of rFSH subcutaneously with the same pre-treatment HCG dose used to normalize testosterone level.',\n",

This solution is produced in three sizes intended for patients with moderately increased, basal or low nutritional requirements. To provide total parenteral nutrition, the addition of trace elements, vitamins and supplemental electrolytes may be required. The dose range of 0.10-0 15 g N/kg/day (0.7-1.0 g amino acid/kg/day) and total energy of 20-30 kcal body weight/day corresponds to approx. 27-40 ml/kg/day.Children: The ability to metabolize individual nutrients must determine the dosage. In general the infusion for small children (2-10 years) should start with a low dose l.e. 14-28 ml/kg (corresponding to 0.49-0.98 g fat/kg/day, 0.34-0.67 g amino acids/kg/day and 0.95-1.9 g glucose/kg/day) and increased by 10-15 ml/kg/day up to maximum dosage of 40 ml/kg/day. For children over 10 years of age the dosage for adults can be applied. The use of this solution is not recommended in children under 2 years of age in whom the amino acid cysteine may be considered conditionally essential.\",\n",

Patients should reevaluate periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary. For treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3-month to 6-month intervals.Usual Dosage: The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator) daily for one or two weeks, then gradually reduced to one-half initial dosage for a similar period.

You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Factor VIII activity refers to the amount of factor VIII present in the plasma. It is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human blood plasma) or in International Units (IU). The dosage of factor VIII is expressed in IU. One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human blood plasma. One IU of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5%-2% of normal activity.

It is evergreen, vigorous and has wide adaptability. 5HTP is commercially produced by extraction from the seeds.Valerian: Valerian is an herb that is widely available in a variety of commercial preparations and is commonly used as a sleep aid. Valeriana officinalis extract comes from a flowering plant native to Europe and Asia, but is also found in North America. Valerian contains over 150 constituents, many of which are physiologically active.

Produced commercially by extraction from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia.Valerian extract is effective in treating mild-to-moderate sleeping disorders without adverse effects on REM sleep and without significant hangover effects. Valerian has a sedative-hypnotics, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant and antispasmodic effects.5HTP acts primarily by within the centralesing levels of serotonin nervous system. Other neurotransmitters and CNS chemicals, such as melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and beta endorphin have also been shown to increase following oral administration of 5HTP.Valepotriate binds to dopamine receptors. Valerenic acid also appears to inhibit the enzyme system responsible for the central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activities.Valerian extracts containing amino acids and valerenic acid bind with the GABA-A receptor. In the brain cortex.Extract of Valerian inhibits the uptake and stimulates the release of GABA, leading to increase concentration of GABA in synaptic clefts.

It is evergreen, vigorous and has wide adaptability. 5HTP is commercially produced by extraction from the seeds.Valerian: Valerian is an herb that is widely available in a variety of commercial preparations and is commonly used as a sleep aid. Valeriana officinalis extract comes from a flowering plant native to Europe and Asia, but is also found in North America. Valerian contains over 150 constituents, many of which are physiologically active.

Produced commercially by extraction from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia.Valerian extract is effective in treating mild-to-moderate sleeping disorders without adverse effects on REM sleep and without significant hangover effects. Valerian has a sedative-hypnotics, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant and antispasmodic effects.5HTP acts primarily by within the centralesing levels of serotonin nervous system. Other neurotransmitters and CNS chemicals, such as melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and beta endorphin have also been shown to increase following oral administration of 5HTP.Valepotriate binds to dopamine receptors. Valerenic acid also appears to inhibit the enzyme system responsible for the central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activities.Valerian extracts containing amino acids and valerenic acid bind with the GABA-A receptor. In the brain cortex.Extract of Valerian inhibits the uptake and stimulates the release of GABA, leading to increase concentration of GABA in synaptic clefts. Valerenic acid may increasing inhibit enzymes that break down GABA, thus GABA levels and producing CNS-depressing effect.'},\n",

Andrographis has flavonoids, which always have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that the flavonoid activities suppressed the genetic expression of neutrophils. Similarly, studies have indicated that a variety of inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, are reduced by the presence of Andrographoloid.The aerial parts and their constituent andrographolides have antihepato-toxic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of a methanol extract of the aerial parts to mice reduced hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4, and reversed CCl4 induced histopathological changes in the liver. Intraperitoneal administration of andrographolide to mice inhibited the CCl4 induced increase in the activity of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides. Andrographolide, the major antihepatotoxic component of the plant, exerted a pronounced protective effect in rats against hepato-toxicity induced by CCl4, Dgalactosamine, paracetamol and ethanol.Moreover, andrographolide and related diterpenes are choleretic, antidiarrheal, immunostimulant, antimalarial, antipyretic and active in urinary tract infections.'},\n",

It has been used widely in Europe for gynecologic conditions such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), cyclical breast discomfort, menstrual cycle irregularities, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Major active constituents of Chaste berry are iridoid glycosides such as agnuside, aucubin and flavonoids such as casticin. Chaste berry acts as a hormonal modulator by increasing progesterone levels with the corresponding reduction in estrogen levels via the corpus luteum hormone effect. It shows central action at the pituitary gland that inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), promotes the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), and decreases prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland via dopamine antagonistic effect. It is also used for fibrocystic breast, insufficient lactation, corpus luteum insufficiency, prevention of miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy in cases of progesterone insufficiency and acne vulgaris.'},\n",

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging.As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues.Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces. The main elimination of Ubidecarenone occurs with bile.'},\n",

       "     'text': 'Melon extract is an extract of the fruit of the melon (Cucumis melo L). This extract comes from the cantaloupe or muskmelon, which is a member of the gourd family and is native to Africa but grown around the world. It contains vitamin A and C, flavonoids, volatile oils, pectin and fructose.Cantaloupes are filled with antioxidants, including beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin and cryptoxanthin. The fruit also has almost 100% of recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, which is crucial for immune health. Other nutrients in cantaloupes include: Vitamin A. Cucumis melo L extract naturally rich in Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), obtained from a non-GMO proprietary variety of Cantaloupes melon. It is the unique source of bioactive melon Superoxide Dismutase.As a concentrate extract, it is not pure SOD and also contains secondary anti- oxidants such as glutathione, carotenoids, co-enzyme Q10 and vitamin C & E. This active melon concentrate exhibits its highest radical-scavenging activity towards superoxide anions (O2–). Superoxide dismutase constitute a very important antioxidant defense against oxidative stress in the body. The enzyme acts as a good therapeutic agent against reactive oxygen species-mediated diseases.Superoxide dismutase are a group of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O-2) to molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), providing cellular defense against reactive oxygen species.'},\n",

Deficiency of D-chiro-inositol in peripheral tissue causes insulin resistance that leads to hyperandrogenism in ovaries which results polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). D-chiro-inositol helps to regulate the balance between androgen and estrogen by decreasing luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone level. It improves glucose tolerance and reduces circulating insulin. It reduces oxidative stress on follicle and decreases total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. D-chiro-inositol has been clinically proven as an effective treatment of ovarian cyst and PCOS associated metabolic disorders. It helps to improve and regulate normal ovulation after two weeks of administration. It also reduces hyperandrogenism related skin disorders like hirsutism, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans and acne.

In addition, the fruit contains phenols including gallic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, corilagin. A tannin containing gallic acid, ellagic acid and glucose in its molecule are naturally present in the fruit, which prevent the oxidation of vitamin and renders fruit valuable in vitamin C.The presence of flavonoids in the E. officinalis enables them to be used as an antioxidant. It counteracts the toxic effects of prolonged exposure to environmental heavy metals. It increases glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in macrophages and decreases free radical production.E.officinalis is also used to detoxify blood from chemicals and harmful toxic substances and this is due to presence of phenols in E. officinalis, because phenols act as a detoxifying agent. Terpenoids of E. officinalis improves lung function.Piper longum: Piper longum is certainly one of the most widely used of all Ayurvedic herbs for enhancing digestion, assimilation and metabolism of the foods that we eat.

By Increasing HDL level Flaxseed Oil helps to reduce hyperlipidemia. So if we use Flaxseed oil with other Lipid lowering agent it will be very much helpful for patient with hyperlipidemia. Moreover ALA helps to reduce infammation.Flaxseed Oil reduces cholesterol levels by increasing prostaglandins E1 & E3 (PGE1 & PGE3), which inhibit cholesterol synthesis & stimulate cholesterol movement across cell membranes. Also reduces platelet aggregation by increasing levels of PGE1 and PGE3. Flaxseed oil stimulates bowels, binds to water, mucilage swells and stool volume increases. Facilitates passage of feces through bowel through lubrication by oil.'},\n",

Flavonoids of Plumbago zeylanicum help to reduce pain perception by suppressing pain substances like prostaglandins & bradykinin. It also controls excessive collagenase production. Study reveals that analgesic effect is comparable to that of Indomethacin.Nigela sativa: Nigella sativa contains thymoquinone, which inhibits the effect of nociceptive system or inflammatory mediators and reduces pain. The anti-nociceptive effect of Nigella sativa is comparable with that of Naproxen.Vanda Roxburghii: Vanda Roxburghii reduces pain & inflammation. Heptacosane & octacosan of Vanda roxburghii shows anti-inflammatory activity.Zingiber officinale: Gingerol from Zingiber officinale possesses anti-inflammmatory and analgesic properties.

       "     'text': 'Grapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called \"proanthocyanidins\" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase.Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes.Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)'},\n",

Its reduction of thromboxane B2 formation and erythrocyte hemolysis suggests a membrane stabilizing property that interferes with the activation of phospholipase A2. Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia.Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons.Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated.Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic.

Its reduction of thromboxane B2 formation and erythrocyte hemolysis suggests a membrane stabilizing property that interferes with the activation of phospholipase A2. Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia.Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons.Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated.Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It acts as counter irritant and numbs the nerve endings that inhibit the transmission of pain sensation.'},\n",

Under a microscope, spirulina appears as long, thin, blue green spiral threads. It is mostly found in Asia, Africa and central America. Because of its hundreds of health benefits, it is called \"future food\" or \"super food\". Spirulina is often deemed the most nutritionally complete of all food supplements, containing a rich supply of many important nutrients, including protein, complex carbohydrates, iron and vitamins. It contains much more vitamins than a typical synthetic vitam in or any vegetarian meal. It also has essential and non-essential amino acids that are ten times more than meat. It also has a high supply of carotenoids such as beta carotene and yellow xanthophylls which have antioxidant properties. It is also rich in Chlorophyll, fatty and nucleic acids and lipids.'},\n",

       "     'text': \"Spirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food\\xa0which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate.How does it work-About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.\"},\n",

It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines. The therapeutic potential of Undenatured Collagen II in joint disease depends on a specific dose of 40 mg. Glucosamine is the essential building block of joint cartilage that additionally reduces the synthesis of inflammatory and degenerative mediators responsible for the breakdown of the cartilage. Chondroitin is a structural component of cartilage that maintains water and nutrients to promote elasticity and resistance in cartilage. It protects cartilage from premature decline by preventing the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme. Methylsulfonylmethane is necessary to maintain and repair healthy joints, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissues. It reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nitric oxide by suppressing the nuclear factor-kappa β, thus producing an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in reducing osteoarthritis pain and swelling. The combination of these four active ingredients gives a synergistic effect in osteoarthritis and improves joint function.'},\n",
