This impedes the ability of viruses to invade cells and replicate. It also has a major effect activating the general defense functions of the immune system by stimulating the production of antibodies as well as non-specific immune responses such as increased macrophage phagocytosis, rather than by any direct antimicrobial activity. Andrographis has flavonoids, which always have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that the flavonoid activities suppressed the genetic expression of neutrophils. Similarly, studies have indicated that a variety of inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, are reduced by the presence of Andrographoloid.The aerial parts and their constituent andrographolides have antihepato-toxic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of a methanol extract of the aerial parts to mice reduced hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4, and reversed CCl4 induced histopathological changes in the liver. Intraperitoneal administration of andrographolide to mice inhibited the CCl4 induced increase in the activity of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides. Andrographolide, the major antihepatotoxic component of the plant, exerted a pronounced protective effect in rats against hepato-toxicity induced by CCl4, Dgalactosamine, paracetamol and ethanol.Moreover, andrographolide and related diterpenes are choleretic, antidiarrheal, immunostimulant, antimalarial, antipyretic and active in urinary tract infections."

Bacopa extracts modulate the expression of certain enzymes involved in generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species in the brain. It exerts a protective effect against DNA damage in astrocytes and human fibroblasts.Asparagus racemosus is a well-known nervine tonic.

The bacosides aid in repair of damaged neurons by enhancing kinase activity, neuronal synthesis, restoration of synaptic activity and modulating the cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, and ultimately improves nerve impulse transmission.Bacosides appear to have antioxidant activity in the hippocampus, frontal cortexand striatum. Bacopa extracts modulate the expression of certain enzymes involved in generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species in the brain. It exerts a protective effect against DNA damage in astrocytes and human fibroblasts.Asparagus racemosus is a well-known nervine tonic. It plays the role of an antioxidant by attenuating free radical induced oxidative neural damage.

It functions as a coenzyme for mitochondrial carboxylases in hair roots and improves the keratin structure.

Chaste berry is used as a common treatment for gynecological disorders due to its central dopaminergic activity. It has been used widely in Europe for gynecologic conditions such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), cyclical breast discomfort, menstrual cycle irregularities, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Major active constituents of Chaste berry are iridoid glycosides such as agnuside, aucubin and flavonoids such as casticin. Chaste berry acts as a hormonal modulator by increasing progesterone levels with the corresponding reduction in estrogen levels via the corpus luteum hormone effect. It shows central action at the pituitary gland that inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), promotes the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), and decreases prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland via dopamine antagonistic effect. It is also used for fibrocystic breast, insufficient lactation, corpus luteum insufficiency, prevention of miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy in cases of progesterone insufficiency and acne vulgaris."

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging.As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues.Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces. The main elimination of Ubidecarenone occurs with bile."

Cranberry reduces the need for repeated antibiotic use in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infection. Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is generally considered to be the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in human such as UTIs. Cranberry inhibits adherence of bacteria to the lining of the urinary bladder and urethra. At higher dose it also works as a urinary antiseptic and reduces incidence of stone formation. Recent publications show as much as 65% reduction in UTI with cranberry consumption leading to reduced use of antibiotics and reduction in the number of incidences of recurrent cystitis."

Vitamin E protects polyunsaturated fatty acids which are components of cellular membrane and other oxygen-sensitive substances such as vitamin A & vitamin C from oxidation. Vitamin E reacts with free radicals, which is the cause of oxidative damage to cell membranes, without the formation of another free radical in the process. The main pharmacological action of vitamin E in humans is its antioxidant effect.In premature neonates, irritability, edema, thrombosis and hemolytic anemia may be caused due to vitamin E deficiency.

Vitamin E protects polyunsaturated fatty acids which are components of cellular membrane and other oxygen-sensitive substances such as vitamin A & vitamin C from oxidation. Vitamin E reacts with free radicals, which is the cause of oxidative damage to cell membranes, without the formation of another free radical in the process. The main pharmacological action of vitamin E in humans is its antioxidant effect.In premature neonates, irritability, edema, thrombosis and hemolytic anemia may be caused due to vitamin E deficiency. Creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, decreased erythrocyte survival or increased in vitro hemolysis by oxidizing agents have been identified in adults and children with low serum tocopherol concentrations.The usage of vitamin E eliminates its deficiency.

Deficiency of D-chiro-inositol in peripheral tissue causes insulin resistance that leads to hyperandrogenism in ovaries which results polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). D-chiro-inositol helps to regulate the balance between androgen and estrogen by decreasing luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone level. It improves glucose tolerance and reduces circulating insulin. It reduces oxidative stress on follicle and decreases total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. D-chiro-inositol has been clinically proven as an effective treatment of ovarian cyst and PCOS associated metabolic disorders. It helps to improve and regulate normal ovulation after two weeks of administration. It also reduces hyperandrogenism related skin disorders like hirsutism, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans and acne. It lowers cardiovascular risk in women who are suffering from PCOS by controlling arterial pressure."

It contains Emblicanin A & B, Puniglucanin, Pedunculagin, 2-keto-gluconolactone (vitamin-C equivalents), ellagic acid, hexahydroxy-diphenic acid and conjugates. In addition, the fruit contains phenols including gallic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, corilagin. A tannin containing gallic acid, ellagic acid and glucose in its molecule are naturally present in the fruit, which prevent the oxidation of vitamin and renders fruit valuable in vitamin C.The presence of flavonoids in the E. officinalis enables them to be used as an antioxidant. It counteracts the toxic effects of prolonged exposure to environmental heavy metals. It increases glutathione (GSH) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in macrophages and decreases free radical production.E.officinalis is also used to detoxify blood from chemicals and harmful toxic substances and this is due to presence of phenols in E. officinalis, because phenols act as a detoxifying agent. Terpenoids of E. officinalis improves lung function.Piper longum: Piper longum is certainly one of the most widely used of all Ayurvedic herbs for enhancing digestion, assimilation and metabolism of the foods that we eat. It is also highly prized for its ability to enhance the assimilation and potency of herbs. In a study, antiulcerogenic activity of Piper longum was noted against gastric ulcer."

Clinical studies have focused on its use in the treating problems associated with essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency including premenstrual syndrome, atopic eczema, inflammation and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) is relatively high in essential fatty acids (EFAs), particularly gamma-linolenic acid (GLA,7-10%)."

The bioactivity of EPO is due primarily to its GLA contents. By supplying GLA, it bypasses the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of LA. After ingestion of EPO, GLA is rapidly absorbed and then converts directly to DGLA and other prostaglandin precurosors. It also acts on the prostanoids pathway."

Lutein and Zeaxanthin are especially concentrated in rods which are specialized light sensitive cell or photoprotector in retina and responsible for black and white vision in the dark. Scientific evidence clearly suggests that Lutein and Zeaxanthin has important role in the retina to protect tissue from the damaging effects of high-energy blue spectrum light. The uncontrolled generation of free radicals in the eye and harmful light are believed to ultimately lead to age related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa.

It is familiar as grapes or Drakkha in Bangladesh.Chemical constituents: The chemical analysis has shown the presence of proanthocyanidins (PCOs) including procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavanoids. 3-oxo-a-ionol, vomifoliol and dehydrovomifoliol were identified for the first time in fruit from Vitis vinifera.

Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase.Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes.Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)"

Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia.Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons.Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated.Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic.

Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia.Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons.Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated.Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It acts as counter irritant and numbs the nerve endings that inhibit the transmission of pain sensation."

The inhibitory effect is comparable with standard antibiotics Amoxicillin and Ciprofloxacin. Moreover Woodfordia fruticosa flowers provide non-specific immunity. It stimulates reticulo endothelial system and release of cytokines from macrophages. Proliferation of bone marrow cells indicates the plausible release of colony stimulating factors, which further stimulates the immune system through generation of immune cells.Hemidesmus indicus: Chemical analysis of the root showed the presence of coumarin, volatile oil and two sterols. 2-hydroxy-4 methoxy benzaldehyde is isolated from the root of the Hemidesmus indicus which has anti-inflammatory activity against chronic inflammation. Also the drug is revealed significant anti-fungal activity in experimental and clinical studies.Acacia catechu: Acacia catechu is highly valuable for its powerful astringent and antioxidant activities. It exhibits various pharmacological effects like antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Catechins and taxifolin is principal constituent of Acacia catechu which have significant antimicrobial effects. Chronic gonorrhea can be treated with Acacia catechu.Mangifera indica: Mangifera indica contains active substances like mangiferin, which has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity.

It completely suppresses replication of the Influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Rhinovirus, Coronavirus, Parainfluenza virus and Coxsackie virus.Pelargonium sidoides usually inhibits the interaction of bacteria and viruses with host cells, increases ciliary beat frequency on respiratory cells. Expel pathogens by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways thereby prevents infection & makes breathing easier. It also boosts immune system by the activation of macrophages."

Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions:Anti-toxin activity: S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile.Anti-microbial: S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements.Enzymatic activity: In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules).Immune Enhancement: S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA.Anti-inflammatory: S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines."

Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions:Anti-toxin activity: S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile.Anti-microbial: S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements.Enzymatic activity: In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules).Immune Enhancement: S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA.Anti-inflammatory: S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines."

Clinical study suggests that Saffron acts as a mood enhancer and antidepressant by up-regulating dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the brain. Saffron has a high affinity for hippocampus of the brain and it switches off chronic inflammation in the hippocampus. It also increases neural-plasticity to form new neural connections. Saffron relieves different symptoms of major depressive disorders such as weight loss or excessive weight gain, sleep disturbance, anhedonia, impaired cognition, sadness and loss of productivity at work.

It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer mem- brane of liver cells. Silymarin also acts by anti-lipid peroxidative, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, membrane stabilizing, immunomodulatory and liver regenerating mechanisms. Dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E) is a tocol which is one of the most potent anti- oxidant tocopherols. It exhibits antioxidant activity by virtue of the phenolic hydrogen on the 2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol nucleus. Vitamin E has powerful antioxidant properties which can provide numerous benefits to the body, and may protect cells from oxidative damage."

Under a microscope, spirulina appears as long, thin, blue green spiral threads. It is mostly found in Asia, Africa and central America. Because of its hundreds of health benefits, it is called \"future food\" or \"super food\". Spirulina is often deemed the most nutritionally complete of all food supplements, containing a rich supply of many important nutrients, including protein, complex carbohydrates, iron and vitamins. It contains much more vitamins than a typical synthetic vitam in or any vegetarian meal. It also has essential and non-essential amino acids that are ten times more than meat. It also has a high supply of carotenoids such as beta carotene and yellow xanthophylls which have antioxidant properties. It is also rich in Chlorophyll, fatty and nucleic acids and lipids."

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate.How does it work-About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body."

It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines. The therapeutic potential of Undenatured Collagen II in joint disease depends on a specific dose of 40 mg. Glucosamine is the essential building block of joint cartilage that additionally reduces the synthesis of inflammatory and degenerative mediators responsible for the breakdown of the cartilage. Chondroitin is a structural component of cartilage that maintains water and nutrients to promote elasticity and resistance in cartilage. It protects cartilage from premature decline by preventing the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme. Methylsulfonylmethane is necessary to maintain and repair healthy joints, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissues. It reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nitric oxide by suppressing the nuclear factor-kappa β, thus producing an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in reducing osteoarthritis pain and swelling. The combination of these four active ingredients gives a synergistic effect in osteoarthritis and improves joint function."

It also interacts with compounds that are nonselectively stimulated by norepinephrine and epinephrine. Yohimbe has a modest beneficial effect in the management of erectile dysfunction.
